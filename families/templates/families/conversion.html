            <p>We created a new type of account for the AI Family Challenge - a <b>family account.</b> A Family Account is a shared account, where every member of your family can log into the same account, upload their progress, and access additional resources. A Family Account is required to participate in the AI Family Challenge.</p>
            <p>With a family account you can:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Track your progress through each stage of the challenge through a new dashboard</li>
              <li>Find additional resources related to the challenge</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will still have access to all Curiosity Machine design challenges with a family account, and you will not lose any completed or in-progress design challenges when you switch. Everything will be transferred!</p>
            <p>After you push the button below, you will be asked to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Update your contact and location information</li>
              <li>Add at least one guardian and one child to the account, you can add up to 6 members</li>
              <li>Fill out the parent pre-survey through Surveymonkey</li>
              <li>Complete the electronic AI Family Challenge consent form which will be emailed to the email address you provide</li>
