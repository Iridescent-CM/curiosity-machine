        <p>In order to better meet the needs of our users, we’re closing parent accounts, but all parents will have the option to convert their accounts to our new family accounts, student, educator or coach accounts. This change doesn’t mean that there is no longer a place for parents – you are vital to Curiosity Machine, and we are confident that you’ll find a better fit in one of our upgraded account options.</p>
