        <h2>Why AI?</h2>
        <p>
          The World Economic Forum estimates that 65 percent of children entering primary school today will work in completely new jobs that donâ€™t exist yet. With this new initiative, Iridescent aims to demystify Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI tools for students and families and provide early introductions to the technology that is reshaping the workforce and encourage them to continue to learn about and engage with AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Curiosity Machine AI Family Challenge invites you to learn about Artificial Intelligence technology. Throughout 2018, children ages 8 to 15 and their families will explore core concepts of AI and use these tools to solve problems in their communities. Everyone will have the opportunity to enter their ideas into a global competition.
        </p>
