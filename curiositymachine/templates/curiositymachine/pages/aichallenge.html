      <p>
        Did you know that Alexa and Siri use artificial intelligence (AI) to answer your questions? 
        Or, that Youtube and Netflix recommend videos with the help of machine learning? 
        Many technologies that surround us are changing how we work and play using AI.
      </p> 
      <p>
        The <a href="/challenges/?aifamilychallenge=1" target="_blank">AI Family Challenge</a> is a free, hands-on AI education program that brings families, schools, 
        communities, and technology know-it-alls together to give everyone the chance to learn, play and create 
        with AI.
