      <h2>Welcome to the<br/>Curiosity Machine AI Family Challenge!</h2>
      <h3 class="mb-3">Artificial Intelligence should be accessible to everyone.</h3>
      <p>
        The Curiosity Machine AI Family Challenge invites families to learn about Artificial Intelligence technology. Over the next 2 years, 3rd-8th grade students and their families will explore core concepts of AI research, apply AI tools to solve problems in their communities and have the opportunity to enter their ideas into a global competition.
      </p>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Stage 1:</dt>
        <dd>
          Families will learn the foundations of Artificial Intelligence. Families will build hands-on projects that make core concepts tangible and prepare them for the remainder of the program. Families will continue learning about AI, building hands-on projects, and submit their work online through the Curiosity Machine platform.
        </dd>
        <dt>Stage 2:</dt>
        <dd>
          Families at in-person sites and individuals building online will identify problems in their local communities that AI tools could help address and begin building solutions to those problems.
        </dd>
        <dt>Stage 3:</dt>
        <dd>
          We will host a series of regional celebration events for families to share their projects. The strongest projects will move on to the global competition, where families will have the opportunity to win scholarships and prizes.
