      <p>
        Did you know that Alexa and Siri use artificial intelligence (AI) to answer your questions? 
        Or, that Youtube and Netflix recommend videos with the help of machine learning? 
        Many technologies that surround us are changing how we work and play using AI.
      </p> 
      <p>
        The <a href="{% url "challenges:challenges" %}?aifamilychallenge=1" target="_blank">AI Family Challenge</a> is a free, hands-on AI education program that brings families, schools, 
        communities, and technology know-it-alls together to give everyone the chance to learn, play and create 
        with AI.

              I really didn’t know much about new technology. This program was so informative! My son who wants to become 
              an electrician got to experience something that he wants and likes. Without [AI Family Challenge] I would have 
              not tried to do these amazing things at home. This was a great program that I would recommend to all.

              [With AI Family Challenge], our analytical thinking has improved and we now explore different ways of 
              solving or arriving at a conclusion. We also realize that we should always try and keep trying with projects, 
              not getting it right the first time does not mean we should give up.

              We had a grandmother that joined the group in Cape Town for a few sessions. She was very shy but loved watching 
              the children build and create. She came to me after the sessions and asked if we could teach her more activities 
              that she could do with her grandchildren at home. She said she would like to continue to see them grow and be joyful 
              together.

              This course gives a lot of opportunities not only to get more information about AI, but also teaches us how to work 
              like one team, our family team. Practice [helps us learn], and this method differs from methods which our children 
              have been taught at schools.
