        <h3>STEM Mentor Support</h3>
        <p>Connect your students with STEM experts! Curiosity Machine mentors are professional scientists and engineers who volunteer to support your students.</p>
        <p>When your student begins a new design challenge, a mentor claims their project and starts a conversation with the student.</p>
        <p>Curiosity Machine mentors...</p>
        <ul>
          <li>support individual student projects from start to finish</li>
          <li>offer helpful feedback and suggestions when students get stuck</li>
          <li>push students to iterate and improve their designs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Curiosity Machine screens and trains all mentors before they begin working with students. Parents and educators of students can also view all mentor-student interactions.</p>
