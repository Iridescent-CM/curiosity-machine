      <h2>Your Work is Inspiring</h2>
      <h3 class="mb-4">Share it with the world!</h3>
      <p class="my-4">Curiosity Machine works with industry experts to bring science and engineering education to children and families. Want to bring your expertise to families? Below are four ways you can get involved. If you want to learn more, contact us at <a href="mailto:curiosity@iridescentlearning.org">curiosity@iridescentlearning.org</a>.</p>
      <h4>Be a Judge</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5 offset-md-1 mt-2">
      <em>See what problems families from all over the world want to use AI to solve.</em>
      <p class="mt-1">As a judge, you will view families' submissions to the AI Family Challenge and score them based on an objective judging rubric. Submissions will reflect the culmination of months of work and learning from families across the world as they learn about AI tools and technologies and incorporate what they learn into a project to solve a community problem. Judges will be asked to complete a 30 minute online training in January of 2020 and review AIFC submissions in February. You do not need to be an AI expert or have a technical background!</p>
