            <h3>Information We Collect From Children Under 13</h3>

            <p>Curiositymachine.org limits the collection of personally identifiable information from children to only that which is reasonably necessary to obtain parental consent or to participate in a Curiositymachine.org program or activity after we have obtained parental consent. Curiositymachine.org is prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity at Curiositymachine.org on the disclosure of more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity. Children under 13 years old are not allowed to subscribe or create an account without a parent or guardian's consent.</p>

                <h3>Parental Consent</h3>

                <p>We require a parent or guardian to consent before a child under the age of 13 can use any Curiositymachine.org products or services or participate in any Curiositymachine.org programs or activities.</p>

                <p>Parents can provide consent in person, online, or by fax or postal mail for their children to provide personally identifiable information to us. The parental consent enables children under 13 to access Curiositymachine.org products or services or participate in Curiositymachine.org programs or activities. The parental consent form may be downloaded from the Curiositymachine.org. Upon receipt of the parental
                consent form, Curiositymachine.org will send you an e-mail to confirm that your child's account has been
                activated.</p>

                <p>To provide consent by fax or postal mail, parents should fill out the parental consent form, sign it and send it to Iridescent at:</p>
