        <h3 class="mb-4">Your child is the future. So is artificial intelligence.</h3>
        <p>Children spend less than 15% of the year in school, so we’ve developed the AI Family Challenge to empower parents and entire families to keep learning together year-round. Through one account, the entire family can learn and build at home. You have access to our specialized curriculum consisting of three stages. You will be able to complete all of the challenges and lessons that lead you to create your own capstone project, which you can submit into the competition. You'll need some materials, but don't worry - they are all things you probably already have at home or are very low-cost. You'll also become part of an online community of families building together.</p>
        <p>Note: You don’t need to be a science or math expert to take part! Learn more about the curriculum <a href="{% url "aichallenge/curriculum" %}" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
