      <h4 class="aifc-pages-header">What does a program site look like?</h4>
      <p>Program sites are different throughout the world. Generally, we seek locations that deliver programs outside of school to underserved families. Also, your location should have 1-5 passionate facilitators who are ready to lead.</p>
      <p>Our full program is 20+ hours and directed by people like you. We know that's a big commitment so we're here to help!</p>

      <h4>Friend of the Program</h4>
      <p>You are ready to lead our program, but it looks a little different from a club or chapter. Examples of our Friends can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Educators supporting kids who are excited to participate, but no  guardians (children can complete the program but please remember that only Family Teams are eligible to submit for the AI World Championship!)</li>
        <li>Leaders of small family or afterschool groups who are participating</li>
        <li>Anyone who is excited to bring some of our program, but not all 20 hours, to participants</li>
      </ul>
