# Fixtures

Notes about the fixtures can be left here to express their intention, though remember
that the final authority is the fixture itself, and they're not that hard to read.

## Notes

* **basic-users**: a set of basic users for the site, including child, teen, mentor and admin
* **basic-challenges**: a couple of basic dummy challenges
* **progress-basic-challenges**: this builds on **basic-challenges** to simulate some back and forth between child and mentor,
and put different challenges in different states
