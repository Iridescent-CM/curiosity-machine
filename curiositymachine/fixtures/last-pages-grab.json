With the support of a parent, even young children can navigate the site, upload their designs, and become inventors in the Curiosity Machine community!</p>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p><b>What does it cost to use Curiosity Machine?</p></b> \r\n<p>Curiosity Machine is a free and open tool. Anyone can create an account and use all Curiosity Machine features, and our engineering design challenges can be completed with simple, low cost materials. </p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>What kind of technology do I need to use Curiosity Machine?</p></b> \r\n<p>You can access the Curiosity Machine and our online community of mentors on any smartphone, tablet, or computer with a browser and internet access. Ideally, your device has a built-in camera to take photos and videos as you move through the engineering design process (you can also use a digital camera and upload photos to your device).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find more technology recommendations on page 7 of our <a href=\"http://iridescentlearning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Curiosity-Kit-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Curiosity Kit.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>What are engineering design challenges?</p></b>\r\n<p>We believe children learn by building. Engineering design challenges are hands-on projects inspired by the cutting-edge work of scientists and engineers. In each challenge, children are presented with a complex problem to solve, and they progress with support from a trained mentor who guides and encourages them to persist through failure and bring their ideas to reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>How long does it take to complete an engineering design challenge?</p></b> \r\n<p>Most design challenges will take about 90 minutes to plan, build, test, and submit to the site for mentor feedback. A mentor will respond within 3-5 days, and then you can start the redesign process! The redesign process can go on for as long as you can make  improvements to the design--and the same mentor will be ready to offer feedback on every change you make. </p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>Should Curiosity Machine engineering design challenges be completed in  sequence?</p></b> \r\n<p>Our design challenges do not need to be completed in any particular order. If you\u2019re looking for ideas of what challenge to do next, try focusing on a particular theme (like Aerospace or Civil Engineering), or follow one of <a href=\"http://iridescentlearning.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cm-Suggested-Series.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">our suggested series!</a> </p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>Who are Curiosity Machine mentors? How will they help my child?</p></b>\r\n<p>Mentors are professional scientists and engineers from all over the world who are dedicated to inspiring the next generation of inventors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of our mentors are volunteers, choosing to use their passion to inspire others. Mentors must successfully complete training before working with any user on Curiosity Machine. This training prepares them to work with children across a range of abilities, and to foster growth mindset, persistence, creativity, and curiosity in the children they work with. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When children submit text, photos or videos of a design challenge, one of our mentors will claim their challenge and respond with feedback. Look for the orange icon on your challenge that indicates a mentor message waiting for you! </p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>I created an account for a child under the age of 13, but the account is locked. How do I unlock this account?</b></p> \r\n<p>Because users upload photos and videos to the Curiosity Machine, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires that we obtain parental consent before activating Curiosity Machine accounts for children under the age of 13. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To unlock your child\u2019s account please submit <a href =\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/curiositymachine/statics/parental-consent-and-privacy-policy.pdf\">this consent form</a> to <a href=\"mailto:curiosity@iridescentlearning.org\" target=\"_blank\">curiosity@iridescentlearning.org</a></p> \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>Where can I buy Curiosity Machine design challenge materials?</p></b>\r\n<p>Most design challenges can be completed with simple, low-cost materials that can be obtained at a grocery or hardware store.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<div id=\"divusing\">\r\n<h3>Using Curiosity Machine</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Confused or stuck? Check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBAE46x2qio\" target=\"_blank\">demo video</a> to walk through the Curiosity Machine website and learn how to submit your design challenges, view feedback, respond to feedback, and access challenges you\u2019re still working on.</p> \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>Why haven\u2019t I received any mentor feedback for my engineering design challenge?</p></b>\r\n<p>We try to respond to every design within 3 to 5 days after it\u2019s submitted. Weekends and holidays or technical problems may prolong our usual response times. If it has been more than 5 days get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:curiosity@iridescentlearning.org\">curiosity@iridescentlearning.org</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>What does the orange icon on my project mean?</p></b>\r\n<p>Woohoo! That orange icon means that you have received feedback from a mentor! Select the challenge and see what you mentor has to say \u2013 and don\u2019t forget to respond!</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>How do I respond to mentor feedback?</p></b>\r\n<p>Once you have mentor feedback, you may have the option to continue to the next stage of the engineering design process. Or, you can ask your mentor for additional help and continue to improve on your design! Continue to post pictures, video, and text of your design process.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>How do I see the design challenges that I am currently working on?</p></b>\r\n<p>All of your design challenges live on your profile homepage. To get to your homepage, log in, then click on the menu tab and select \u201cHome.\u201d You should see all of the challenges you\u2019re working on, as well as all the challenges you\u2019ve completed.</p> \r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div id=\"divparents\">\r\n<h3>Parents</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><b>I want to use Curiosity Machine at home, but I\u2019m not a science expert. How can I support my child to learn science?</b></p> \r\n\r\n<p>We believe you don\u2019t need to be a scientist or engineer to help your child learn science! You also don\u2019t need to have all the answers--when you explore and learn alongside your child, you\u2019ll be modeling curiosity and persistence, inspiring them to ask questions and look for answers instead of giving up when they don\u2019t know something. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.curiositymachine.org/parents/\">resources for parents</a> to learn more about how to support your child in our engineering design challenges.</p> \r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b><p>How do I know what my child is doing? </b></p>\r\n<p>If your child is younger than 13, your child\u2019s account is linked to your email. If your child has received feedback from a mentor, you will get an email notification. You can also log onto your child\u2019s account to see what engineering design challenges they have uploaded and the mentor feedback they have received.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<b><p>Why is mentor feedback valuable to my child?</b></p>\r\n<p>Mentors provide encouraging and content-rich feedback to children throughout the building process. This support helps reinforce key science concepts, but it also inspires children to be more creative and persistent as it motivates them to continue improving their designs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Receiving feedback from a professional is a really cool experience--it feels like both a \u201ccongratulations!\u201d and a \u201ckeep going!\u201d Oftentimes, mentors come to occupy the place of role models for children, through interacting and problem solving as a team. </p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b><p>Is Curiosity Machine safe for my child to use?</b></p>\r\n<p>Curiosity Machine takes our users\u2019 safety very seriously. We comply with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), requiring parental consent for accounts for children under the age of 13. Additionally, our mentors undergo required training on interacting with children online. Please be aware that student project pictures are uploaded to the inspiration gallery, which is visible to other users.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>For more information about family internet safety, we recommend the information and advice found at <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/blog/internet-safety-rules-of-the-road-for-kids\">Common Sense Media.</a></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div id=\"diveducators\">\r\n    <h3>Educators</h3>\r\n    \r\n    <p><b>How can I use Curiosity Machine at my site?</b></p> \r\n<p>You can use Curiosity Machine any number of ways, but for group settings we recommend our Curiosity Course model. Curiosity Courses meet once a week for 5-6 weeks in 90 minute sessions, giving children time to redesign their projects using feedback from our online mentors. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not sure which design challenges to start with? <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/q6vm0ldevpqbpuu/Cm%20Suggested%20Series.pdf?dl=0\" target=\"_blank\">Our suggested series flyer</a> will get you started! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking for more recommendations?

How do I support my students to build design challenges? </b></p>\r\n<p>Our philosophy is that you don\u2019t need to be a science or an engineering expert to help children learn science. If you can provide the space, materials, and encouragement for children to build, you\u2019re well on your way to creating a meaningful learning experience. We always recommend building a design challenge yourself before facilitating it with a group; your own experience of building will help you better anticipate where your participants might struggle. When children are ready for feedback, get stuck on a part of their design, or just have a question about how something works, Curiosity Machine\u2019s online mentors are there to support! </p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b><p>Is there funding available for implementing Curiosity Machine at my site? </b></p>\r\n<p>We unfortunately do not offer funding for Curiosity Machine programs, but we strive to make our website and curriculum open and accessible to all. It\u2019s free for anyone to create an account and use all Curiosity Machine features, and our engineering design challenges can be completed with simple, low cost materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b><p>Do you offer training on how to use Curiosity Machine in a classroom or after-school setting? </b></p>\r\n<p>Yes! Our team offers professional development that supports our partners in using the website, facilitating design challenges, and creating a supportive learning environment that encourages a child\u2019s natural curiosity, creativity, and persistence. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For information on upcoming webinars, <a href=\"http://iridescentlearning.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b10254bbb5db780d1af913317&id=5c4692fa5b\" target=\"_blank\">sign up for our educator news.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p> For inquiries about in-person or online trainings, email <a href=\"mailto:curiosity@iridescentlearning.org\">curiosity@iridescentlearning.org.</a></p>  \r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"divmentors\">\r\n    <h3>Mentors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><b>How do I become a Curiosity Machine mentor? </p></b>\r\n<p>Learn more and sign up on our <a href=\"http://www.curiositymachine.org/mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Mentor page</a>. </p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p><b>What are the benefits of becoming a Curiosity Machine mentor?</p></b>\r\n<p>Help inspire the next generation of inventors while improving your science communication and mentoring skills!
