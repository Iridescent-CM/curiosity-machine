    <h3>Boeing-Iridescent Partnership</h3>
    <p>As part of Boeing’s centennial, Boeing engineers teamed up with several leading educational partners to co-create K-12 educational resources that celebrate the science behind the past 100 years of aerospace advancement and ready students, families and teachers with skills for the next century. With Iridescent, one of these Centennial education partners, Boeing is developing more than 20 design challenges inspired by the work of Boeing engineers to contribute to the Curiosity Machine. Students and their families work together to complete design challenges and master key concepts. The design challenges make use of very simple, low cost materials, and are intended to help students practice the essential 21st century skills of curiosity, creativity and persistence. Working through the Curiosity Machine, families and educators work together toward solutions to these design challenges with the online support and guidance of mentoring scientists and engineers.
