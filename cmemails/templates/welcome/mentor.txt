Hi  {{ mentor.username }}!

Thanks for joining our mentor community on the Curiosity Machine! We want to have a stellar 

community of scientists and engineers advising students, and so we ask all of our mentors to 

complete a short training course. The training is made up of three main learning exercises. You 

can complete these at your own pace, however, we do ask that you finish the full training within 

a week. 

Get started by filling out your mentor profile and introducing yourself to the community in Task 

#1 [link https://www.curiositymachine.org/training/2/1/]! We will give you comments at each task 

stage and approve your account once you finish the training. Thank you for supporting the next 

generation of scientists and engineers!

Best regards,

Curiosity Machine Team
