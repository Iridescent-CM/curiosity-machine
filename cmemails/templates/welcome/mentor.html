Hi {{ mentor.first_name | default:mentor.user.username }}!
</p>

<p>
Thanks for joining our mentor community on the Curiosity Machine! We want to have a stellar community of scientists and engineers advising students, and so we ask all of our mentors to complete a short training course. The training is made up of three main learning exercises. You can complete these at your own pace, however, we do ask that you finish the full training within a week. 
</p>

<p>
Get started by filling out your mentor profile and introducing yourself to the community in Task #1 <a href="https://www.curiositymachine.org/training/2/1/">https://www.curiositymachine.org/training/2/1/</a>! We will give you comments at each task  stage and approve your account once you finish the training. Thank you for supporting the next generation of scientists and engineers!
</p>

<p>
Best regards, <br />
Curiosity Machine Team
