Hi {{ mentor.first_name | default:mentor.user.username }}!

Your student [student’s first name or username] just responded to the feedback you gave on their design challenge! Looks like they’re ready for you to see their new design! 

Have a moment now? Let’s give them the ideas and encouragement they need to achieve the challenge goal!

Once you think they’re finished, make sure to move them to the Reflect Stage so that they can answer the reflect questions & share their project with others!
