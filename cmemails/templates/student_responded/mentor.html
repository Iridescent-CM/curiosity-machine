Hi {{ profile.first_name | default:profile.user.username }}!
</p>

<p>
Your student {{ student.first_name | default:student.user.username }} just responded to the feedback you gave on their design challenge! Looks like they’re ready for you to see their new design! 
</p>

<p>
Have a moment now? Let’s give them the ideas and encouragement they need to achieve the challenge goal!
</p>

<p>
Once you think they’re finished, make sure to move them to the Reflect Stage so that they can answer the reflect questions &amp; share their project with others!
</p>
