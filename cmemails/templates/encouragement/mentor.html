Hi {{ profile.first_name | default:profile.user.username }}!

We noticed you’ve been gone for awhile! Our students building at home and in Curiosity Courses are hoping to connect with mentors like you and receive feedback on their design challenges. 
</p>
<p>
Have a moment now? Visit the Curiosity Machine [<a href="{{ site_url }}">{{ site_url }}</a>] to see what our amazing students are building and how you can give them the support to succeed!
</p>
