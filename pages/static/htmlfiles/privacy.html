than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity. Children under 13 years 
old are not allowed to subscribe or create an account without a parent or guardian's

use any Curiosity Machine products or services or participate in any Curiosity 
Machine programs or activities.</p>

provide personally identifiable information to us. The parental consent enables 
children under 13 to access Curiositymachine.org products or services or participate 
in Curiosity Machine programs or activities. Upon receipt of the parental consent 
form, Curiosity Machine will send you an e-mail with a user name and password for 
your child. Upon receipt of the user name and password, please reply to the e-mail,
