<h2>What is the Curiosity Machine?</h2>

<p>The Curiosity Machine is an online community of scientists, engineers and children creating together. The online learning platform hosts Engineering Design Challenges designed to inspire and equip children to create their own unique solutions.</p> 

<br />

<p>In each challenge, children progress through the Engineering Design Process with support from a
trained mentor who guides and encourages them to persist through failure and bring their ideas to 
reality.</p>

<h2>Engineering Design Challenges</h2>

<p>Our challenges are based on actual and innovative science and engineering work. And more: 
<ul>
<li>the challenges are doable with simple, low-cost materials that can be obtained at a grocery store;</li>
<li>they are open-ended and present “low walls and high ceilings” - meaning they are easy to start, but also invite everyone to keep building, to develop more complex designs and solutions;</li>
<li>they emphasize that science is a creative process – not just a collection of right or wrong facts.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Our mission is to inspire children to develop their natural curiosity and hone their investigative skills to become inventors, creators, builders and engineers. We support children, parents, and educators with our friendly project-based science lessons, which help make learning and ‘doing’ science accessible and enjoyable. We are careful to emphasize the Engineering Design Process because we care deeply about helping children become more persistent and creative in the face of failure, so they are better equipped to handle setbacks and frustration wherever they arise. 
The Curiosity Machine is powered by <a href="http://iridescentlearning.org/" target="_blank">Iridescent</a>, a science education non-profit that creates and delivers powerful science, engineering, and technology education to underprivileged children.

<h2>Content Partner</h2>
        <p>Some videos you find in the Curiosity machine are produced by <a href="http://sciencefriday.com/">Science Friday</a>, a trusted source for news and entertaining stories about science. It started as a radio show, created in 1991 by host and executive producer Ira Flatow. Since then, it has grown into much more: SciFri produces award-winning digital videos and publishes original web content covering everything from octopus camouflage to cooking on Mars. Science Friday is brain fun, for curious people</p>
