<h2>Help inspire the next generation of inventors!</h2>

<p>Curiosity Machine connects scientists and engineers with children, inspiring them to be persistent, creative, and curious inventors.</p>
<br />
<p>Our scientist and engineer mentors provide encouraging and content-rich feedback to children, helping them learn science content and encourage them to persist as they build Engineering Design Challenges. As an online mentor, you can connect with children and support their learning in a way that best fits your personal and professional schedule. You can provide students feedback from anywhere with an internet connection and at any time during the day. </p>
<br />
<p>Mentor training is completed online and at your own pace. It involves a 3-part exercise that introduces you to the learning platform and prepares you to give feedback on students' Engineering Design Challenges. It also provides a chance for you to introduce yourself to the other mentors and share your interests with the community.</p>
