<h2>Play inspired by the work of scientists and engineers!</h2>


<p>Curiosity Machine is a space where children can learn and invent with the support of science and engineering experts. </p>
<br />
<p>To join our community, help your child create an account and explore the Engineering Design Challenges. Your child’s Curiosity Machine account will serve as a digital portfolio for his or her drawings, text, and videos of completed Engineering Design Challenges, as well as provide access to <a href="https://www.curiositymachine.org/mentors/">trained mentors</a> who will support the learning process.</p>
<br />
<p>
Any parent with a passion for learning and exploration can use Curiosity Machine with their child to learn science and engineering. No science background is necessary!
</p>

<h2>Support Your Child’s Learning</h2>

<p>Here is a compilation of resources you can use while you have fun building with your child:</p>

<h4>Have a designated night each week for your family to build together.</h4> 
<p>You can use these times to model for your child how to be persistent and imaginative! These nights can also be a great way for you to encourage an atmosphere of learning in your home.</p>
<br />
<h4>Organize a Curiosity Machine Party with your child’s friends!</h4>
<p>Choose an Engineering Design Challenge, gather materials, and be sure to have access to a tablet or a phone with internet so children can upload their work. Building socially is always more creative and fun! </p>
<br />
<h4>Why build Engineering Design Challenges?</h4>
<p>The more children build and redesign their models, the more comfortable they'll become with the Engineering Design Process that professional scientists and engineers use to solve complex problems every day. This greater comfort with failure and re-design will help children persist through all manner of problems, not just those related to science and engineering. Learn more how this process works: </p>
