<h1>Engineering Design Units</h1>
<p>
  To make Curiosity Machine an even better resource for you, we have grouped our engineering design into educator-friendly units!
</p>
<p>
  Check our units below for teacher lesson plans, student workbooks, NGSS Standards Alignment and online support structures.

<h3>How to use these units</h3>
<p>
  Each unit has a series of Curiosity Machine’s engineering design challenges scaffolded together to teach the engineering design process in a classroom setting. We have created supporting tools for each unit to help you bring this hands-on, project based learning to your students!
</p>

<p>
  The basics about each unit:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, with a focus on 6-8th grade Middle School Engineering Design standards, but can be adapted for use into any classroom.</li>
  <li>Contains an Educator Resource Book with five hands-on lesson plans, Frequently Asked Questions and appendix sections.</li>
  <li>Contains a Student Workbook with worksheets that support each lesson.</li>
  <li>Every engineering design challenge in the units is posted and supported on CuriosityMachine.org for you to reference at anytime.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Curiosity Machine provides you with free access to engineering design challenges developed by scientists and engineers and tested by educators.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each challenge guides a student through the steps of the engineering design process, from planning to reflection.</li>
  <li>By documenting their building process online, students get the chance to iterate on their inventions with the support of a trained scientist or engineer mentor. This support is a unique structure for providing highly individualized feedback to each student.</li>
</ul>
